Remove the pan from the heat and pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pasta, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble. Thin out the sauce with a bit of the reserved pasta water, until it reaches desired consistency.\n",

Do not walk away, as I don\\'t know what happens to stainless steel which gets red-hot., The \"potjiekos mixture\" or mixed vegetable pillow pack usually consists of baby carrots, chunks of butternut and sweet potato, a few baby potatoes, and some type of marrow (zucchini or squash)., Clean the onion and chop roughly (on a wooden plank, please)., Now find the tin with the stock powder. You can also use chicken or beef stock, whichever you can actually find, although they are all to your right in the grocery cupboard., Heat a film of canola oil in the hot pot. Do keep in mind that oil heated to a certain degree can catch alight. Should that happen, put the lid on the pot and turn off the gas flame., Okay, let\\'s assume you did not wander away. Chuck the chicken pieces into the film of oil. Use a wooden spoon with a long handle for this via dolorosa, and let them fry on both sides if you can manage that., Add some Aromat -- seasoned salt., Add the potatoes and sort of push them in among the sizzling chicken pieces. Add the chopped onion plus ALL the veggies. Please read list of ingredients again., Add the sugar, salt and seasonings. The amounts are guesswork, but keep more or less to what I put down above, unless you taste it all and want more of something., The herbs and garlic -- over to you. You can either actually get up and go find some fresh herbs at the supermarket, ditto garlic, or use dried from the spice drawer. I know the bottles look small, but you only need about 2 teaspoons per herb for this pot., When everything is cooking nicely, turn it over once or twice with one of my long-handled wooden spoons., Now TURN DOWN the heat completely; you are using a HOT gas plate. You easily let things burn, remember. Put ON the lid., You may now leave it for 10 minutes. Just do not go to your computer and forget the food., Come back, check the liquid -- there should be enough not to cook away. My 2 cups as mentioned are usually quite adequate., Pull the pot, large as it is, towards a smaller gas flame.

Do not walk away, as I don\\'t know what happens to stainless steel which gets red-hot., The \"potjiekos mixture\" or mixed vegetable pillow pack usually consists of baby carrots, chunks of butternut and sweet potato, a few baby potatoes, and some type of marrow (zucchini or squash)., Clean the onion and chop roughly (on a wooden plank, please)., Now find the tin with the stock powder. You can also use chicken or beef stock, whichever you can actually find, although they are all to your right in the grocery cupboard., Heat a film of canola oil in the hot pot. Do keep in mind that oil heated to a certain degree can catch alight. Should that happen, put the lid on the pot and turn off the gas flame., Okay, let\\'s assume you did not wander away. Chuck the chicken pieces into the film of oil. Use a wooden spoon with a long handle for this via dolorosa, and let them fry on both sides if you can manage that., Add some Aromat -- seasoned salt., Add the potatoes and sort of push them in among the sizzling chicken pieces. Add the chopped onion plus ALL the veggies. Please read list of ingredients again., Add the sugar, salt and seasonings. The amounts are guesswork, but keep more or less to what I put down above, unless you taste it all and want more of something., The herbs and garlic -- over to you. You can either actually get up and go find some fresh herbs at the supermarket, ditto garlic, or use dried from the spice drawer. I know the bottles look small, but you only need about 2 teaspoons per herb for this pot., When everything is cooking nicely, turn it over once or twice with one of my long-handled wooden spoons., Now TURN DOWN the heat completely; you are using a HOT gas plate. You easily let things burn, remember. Put ON the lid., You may now leave it for 10 minutes. Just do not go to your computer and forget the food., Come back, check the liquid -- there should be enough not to cook away. My 2 cups as mentioned are usually quite adequate., Pull the pot, large as it is, towards a smaller gas flame. Remember to turn OFF the wok flame!, Turn flame to low, after checking that everything is simmering. Put on the lid. Leave for 20 minutes., Test the potato halves and the carrots from the \"potjiekos pack\" with a fork. If it\\'s soft, the food is done., If there is enough sauce you can always, farm-style, put some bread in your plate and ladle sauce over the bread., Darling, I do hope you can follow this and that you actually get to eat dinner without burning it or finding it tastes awful., Good luck.\\n**Not Suitable for People Who has Allergy**: Legume Allergy, Canola oil, Poultry Allergy, Allium Allergy, Allium Allergy, Potato Allergy, Sugar Allergy / Intolerance]\\n\\n[**Food Name**: Tostadas Our Way\\n**User Rating**: missing stars\\n**Food Category**: One Dish Meal\\n**Cook Time**: 0:20:00\\n**Preparation Time**: 0:05:00\\n**Ingredient Parts**: onion, olive oil, garlic clove, recaito, lean ground beef, dried ancho chile powder, ground cumin, corn tortillas, vegetarian refried beans, salsa, sour cream, avocado, lettuce, cheddar cheese\\n**Ingredient Quantities**: 1/2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 1/2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, missing, missing, missing\\n**Nutrition**:\\n- Calories: 579.1 cals\\n- Carbohydrate: 47.5 g\\n- Protein: 34.5 g\\n- Fat: 28.8 g\\n- Saturated Fat: 13.2 g\\n- Fiber: 10.4 g\\n- Cholesterol: 107.5 mg\\n- Sodium: 844.8 mg\\n- Sugar: 3.7 g\\n**Serving**: 4.0 people\\n**Recipe Instruction**: Sauté the onion in the olive oil over medium-high heat until just soft, then add the garlic and recaito and stir well., Add the ground beef and cook until meat is well-browned, using a spatula to break up the cooked meat into smaller pieces (some folks call this \"hamburger gravel\"), about 8-10 minutes.  Drain off fat.  Add 1 tsp ancho and 1/2 tsp cumin and stir well, cooking for another 2-3 minutes.  Set aside., In a bowl, combine the refried beans, the remaining ancho and cumin, 1/2 cup of salsa, and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Stir well., If using corn tortillas:  heat oil or butter (using butter is is a luxury and a bit decadent, but very tasty!) in a pan and fry the corn tortillas, flat, on both sides until crispy., To make tostada:  spread refried bean mixture, then cooked meat mixture (I prefer my tostadas without meat, but Steingrim puts it on his) onto tostada shell.  Add a bit of salsa and guacamole or avocado chunks on top, then shredded lettuce, grated cheddar, and sour cream.  Eat and enjoy!, Makes 4 servings of 2 tostadas each., Note:  Steingrim likes his extra spicy, so he adds sliced jalapenos, his special very hot salsa or sauce, and extra chopped onion to his

Do not walk away, as I don\\'t know what happens to stainless steel which gets red-hot., The \"potjiekos mixture\" or mixed vegetable pillow pack usually consists of baby carrots, chunks of butternut and sweet potato, a few baby potatoes, and some type of marrow (zucchini or squash)., Clean the onion and chop roughly (on a wooden plank, please)., Now find the tin with the stock powder. You can also use chicken or beef stock, whichever you can actually find, although they are all to your right in the grocery cupboard., Heat a film of canola oil in the hot pot. Do keep in mind that oil heated to a certain degree can catch alight. Should that happen, put the lid on the pot and turn off the gas flame., Okay, let\\'s assume you did not wander away. Chuck the chicken pieces into the film of oil. Use a wooden spoon with a long handle for this via dolorosa, and let them fry on both sides if you can manage that., Add some Aromat -- seasoned salt., Add the potatoes and sort of push them in among the sizzling chicken pieces. Add the chopped onion plus ALL the veggies. Please read list of ingredients again., Add the sugar, salt and seasonings. The amounts are guesswork, but keep more or less to what I put down above, unless you taste it all and want more of something., The herbs and garlic -- over to you. You can either actually get up and go find some fresh herbs at the supermarket, ditto garlic, or use dried from the spice drawer. I know the bottles look small, but you only need about 2 teaspoons per herb for this pot., When everything is cooking nicely, turn it over once or twice with one of my long-handled wooden spoons., Now TURN DOWN the heat completely; you are using a HOT gas plate. You easily let things burn, remember. Put ON the lid., You may now leave it for 10 minutes. Just do not go to your computer and forget the food., Come back, check the liquid -- there should be enough not to cook away. My 2 cups as mentioned are usually quite adequate., Pull the pot, large as it is, towards a smaller gas flame. Remember to turn OFF the wok flame!, Turn flame to low, after checking that everything is simmering. Put on the lid. Leave for 20 minutes., Test the potato halves and the carrots from the \"potjiekos pack\" with a fork. If it\\'s soft, the food is done., If there is enough sauce you can always, farm-style, put some bread in your plate and ladle sauce over the bread., Darling, I do hope you can follow this and that you actually get to eat dinner without burning it or finding it tastes awful., Good luck.\\n**Not Suitable for People Who has Allergy**: Legume Allergy, Canola oil, Poultry Allergy, Allium Allergy, Allium Allergy, Potato Allergy, Sugar Allergy / Intolerance]\\n\\n[**Food Name**: Tostadas Our Way\\n**User Rating**: missing stars\\n**Food Category**: One Dish Meal\\n**Cook Time**: 0:20:00\\n**Preparation Time**: 0:05:00\\n**Ingredient Parts**: onion, olive oil, garlic clove, recaito, lean ground beef, dried ancho chile powder, ground cumin, corn tortillas, vegetarian refried beans, salsa, sour cream, avocado, lettuce, cheddar cheese\\n**Ingredient Quantities**: 1/2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 1/2, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, missing, missing, missing\\n**Nutrition**:\\n- Calories: 579.1 cals\\n- Carbohydrate: 47.5 g\\n- Protein: 34.5 g\\n- Fat: 28.8 g\\n- Saturated Fat: 13.2 g\\n- Fiber: 10.4 g\\n- Cholesterol: 107.5 mg\\n- Sodium: 844.8 mg\\n- Sugar: 3.7 g\\n**Serving**: 4.0 people\\n**Recipe Instruction**: Sauté the onion in the olive oil over medium-high heat until just soft, then add the garlic and recaito and stir well., Add the ground beef and cook until meat is well-browned, using a spatula to break up the cooked meat into smaller pieces (some folks call this \"hamburger gravel\"), about 8-10 minutes.  Drain off fat.  Add 1 tsp ancho and 1/2 tsp cumin and stir well, cooking for another 2-3 minutes.  Set aside., In a bowl, combine the refried beans, the remaining ancho and cumin, 1/2 cup of salsa, and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Stir well., If using corn tortillas:  heat oil or butter (using butter is is a luxury and a bit decadent, but very tasty!) in a pan and fry the corn tortillas, flat, on both sides until crispy., To make tostada:  spread refried bean mixture, then cooked meat mixture (I prefer my tostadas without meat, but Steingrim puts it on his) onto tostada shell.  Add a bit of salsa and guacamole or avocado chunks on top, then shredded lettuce, grated cheddar, and sour cream.  Eat and enjoy!, Makes 4 servings of 2 tostadas each., Note:  Steingrim likes his extra spicy, so he adds sliced jalapenos, his special very hot salsa or sauce, and extra chopped onion to his tostadas.\\n**Not Suitable for People Who has Allergy**: Oral Allergy Syndrome, Legume Allergy, Milk allergy / Lactose intolerance, Corn Allergy, Milk allergy / Lactose intolerance, Allium Allergy,
